            In 2018, 230 cities in mainland China already have regular civil aviation airports, with a total air
            passenger throughput of more than 1.2 billion throughout the year. With the completion and navigation of
            Daxing Airport in Beijing, the planning of Shanghai No. 3 Airport, the airport economy between cities enters
            a new round of integration and competition.
            <br />Through the airport routeline and passenger flow data, we will try to depict a three-dimensional
            picture of regional economic development, and see how cities and urban agglomerations absorb and release the

            <p>
              In the decade from 2009 to 2018, China added 69 civil aviation airports, and the total passenger
              throughput increased by 1.6 times.<br />In 2018, the number of cities with a throughput of over 10 million
              people has reached 37, and the passenger throughput of Beijing Capital Airport has finally exceeded 100
              million. It has become the second airport in the world with a passenger throughput of over 100 million
              passengers after the Atlanta airport in the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
              After examining all the changes in airport throughput and geographical location, we found that growth
              occurred around urban agglomerations or airport clusters. Although all airports have growth,
              Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta and Chengdu-Chongqing, the advantages of
              urban agglomerations are becoming more and more significant.

            <h2>2.2018 China Aviation Network Among Cities</h2>
            <p>
              Passenger throughput is more indicative of the activity of business travel activities, but if we want toit
              is not enough to measure the degree of hub of an airport. To assess the importance of an airport in this
              network, you also need to answer these questions: How far is a city connected through the airport? Who is
              more intimate with whom? What is the range of radiation power?

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              We use the concept of centrality in Network Analysis. Calculated from the relationship between the
              nodes，the centrality seeks to quantify the influence of every node in the network. We can take the airport
              as a node, and an aviation network is formed through the interweaving of airlines. We have comprehensively
              considered the number of airlines between airports in 2018, the number of inbound and outbound flights,
              and calculated the centrality of each airport. The greater the centrality, the greater the importance of
              the airport throughout the aviation network and the greater regional radiation capacity, which are the
              hubs of the entire aviation network.

            <h2>5.The transportation capacity and degree of hubs of Yangtze River Delta is ahead of
              Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei</h2>
            <p>
              In 2017, the National Development and Reform Commission proposed that Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River
              Delta and Pearl River Delta will form three world-class airport groups in 2025. By 2018, the development
              characteristics of these three airport groups are becoming more and more obvious.<br />In the aviation
              network, the Yangtze River Delta is undoubtedly the most influential urban agglomeration. The
              comprehensive strength of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei is not as good as that of the Yangtze River Delta, and it
              is second in the regional competition.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a community, the Yangtze River Delta has now built 16 civil airports, three of which are the highest
              level 4F airports. In 2018, the total throughput of the Yangtze River Delta airport group reached 229
              million. Regardless of the overall number of airports, construction level or throughput scale, the Yangtze
              River Delta is ahead of the other two major airport groups.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              From the point of view of the overall coordinated development of the airport group, the Pearl River Delta
              mainly relies on Guangzhou Baiyun Airport and Shenzhen Baoan Airport to drive the external relations of
              the whole Pearl River Delta region. Guangzhou Baiyun Airport, as the top airport in the region, accounts
              for 53% of the total throughput. Shanghai Pudong Airport has a lower throughput ratio of 32% in the
              Yangtze River Delta. This ensures the coordinated development of airports in the Yangtze River Delta, and
              the internal gap is not too large. The Beijing-Capital International Airport in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei
              account for 70% of the total airport's throughput, and other airports do not contribute too much.

              Behind the centrality and throughput, this land has begun to accelerate on the runway of economic rise,
              not only sitting on unique tourism resources, but also the commercial exchanges between Chengdu and
              Chongqing in recent years, the economic activity is dense, and it is becoming more and more attractive to
              talents.

            <h2>7.Airports in Central China and Northeast China are Less Competitive</h2>
            <p>
              Compared with the fierce struggling among airports in East China, South China, and Southwest China, the
              Central and Northeast China seems “ fall into depression ”.
              <br />Central China’s Changsha
              Huanghua Airport (No. 12), Zhengzhou Xinzheng Airport (No. 13), and Wuhan Tianhe Airport (No. 22) are all
              hubs, but their strength is relatively average, lacking a more conspicuous regional leader. However, this
              is related to the dependence of geographical location on aviation and the diversion of developed
              high-speed rail, which does not absolutely explain the frustration of central China.
              <br />The geographical corner, the underdeveloped northeast of the high-speed rail, but there is no such
              reason, the hub airport in the center of the airport TOP30 in the middle and lower reaches, is actually
              another microcosm of the development in these years.

            <h2>8.TOP10 Hub Cities</h2>
            <p>
              According to the flight routes between hub cities of the airport groups, we could observe the interactions
              among these cities on the aviation network. Major airport groups usually have strong connections. The
              flight routes between Chengdu-Chongqing and the cities in the three major airport groups
              (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangzte River Delta and Pearl River Delta) indicated frequent business travels
              among hub cities. Further more, as mentioned before that more flights travel from Pearl River Delta to
              Shanghai, Chengdu-Chongqing is favored by Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Pearl River Delta travelers. If the
              radiation power of hub cities difines the level of each airport cluster, East China and Southwest China
              are undoubtedly the most powerful areas since the remote geographical locations request more long distant
              travelling. One the othe hand, although North China and Northeast China cities are close to Beijing, they
              are still facing the problem of weak connections on the aviation network.

            <h2>9.Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The pattern of urban warfare has not changed much for many years, and the first-line is
              stable. Strong second-tier cities are eager to move, and the rankings are somewhat floating. This is the
              same in the aviation network.
              <br />
              However, it seems that there are still variables in the regional competition on behalf of the future. The
              radiation power of collective combat in the Yangtze River Delta is super strong, and the degree of
              integration will bring some expectations to the upgrading of urban agglomerations; The Pearl River Delta,
              where both males and females co-exist, is the second, has many possibilities after it joins the Dawan
              District of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao; The Chengdu-Chongqing twins are fascinating in the West, and
              there is potential for new industries, businesses and tourism development.

              <br />The regional development issues often discussed by Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei old-fashioned people are
              also reflected in the route network hub. Even if they have the strongest hub cities in the country, when
              talking about the overall energy level of the urban agglomeration, the combat effectiveness is often
              difficult to explode.
              <br />What is certain is that the competition in urban agglomerations is becoming more and more intense.
